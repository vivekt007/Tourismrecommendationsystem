Tourism Recommendation System utilizes machine learning algorithms to provide personalized travel recommendations.
This study proposes an intelligent Tourism Recommendation System (TRS) that utilizes machine learning algorithms to provide personalized travel recommendations. By analyzing user preferences, historical data, and online reviews, the TRS generates accurate suggestions for destinations and activities. The system incorporates collaborative filtering and deep learning models to enhance recommendation accuracy. Additionally, sentiment analysis techniques are employed to consider the sentiments expressed by other travelers. The TRS benefits both individual travelers and tourism industry stakeholders by assisting in decision-making and optimizing business operations. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed system.
